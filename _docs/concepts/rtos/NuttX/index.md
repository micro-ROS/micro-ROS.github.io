NuttX emphasizes its compliance with standards - including POSIX - and small footprint. It can be fit on 8- to 32-bit microcontrollers. The use of POSIX and ANSI standards, together with the mimic it does to UNIX APIs, makes it friendly to the developers that are used to Linux. NuttX is licensed under BSD license and makes use of the GNU toolchain.
