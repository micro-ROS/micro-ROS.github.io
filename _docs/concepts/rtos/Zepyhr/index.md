Zephyr is a fairly new open-source RTOS, developed in a Linux Foundation Project. The members of this project include several renowned semiconductor companies. Zephyr [strives for a functional safety certification](https://www.zephyrproject.org/zephyr-project-rtos-first-functional-safety-certification-submission-for-an-open-source-real-time-operating-system/), which would make it the first open-source RTOS with such a certification.
