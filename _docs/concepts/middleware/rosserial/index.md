title: micro-ROS compared to rosserial

In ROS, there is a package that stands out when we want to send ROS messages through serial communications.
This package is rosserial.

rosserial allows platforms based on microcontrollers to communicate with a regular computer communicating with ROS network on its behalf.
rosserial provides the protocol to set such communication, using a client-server architecture approach.
rosserial-clients serialise data into the serial link, then, the serialised data is received by the rosserial-server and forwarded to the conventional ROS network.
An analogous process is done to forward data from the ROS network towards the microcontroller.
This rosserial-server can be used either in C++ or Python; meanwhile, the rosserial-client has a set of available supported microprocessors.

This solution is commonly used to integrate hardware pieces within Robots using ROS.
Rosserial, in those cases, acts as a bridge between hardware communication protocols and a ROS network.

## micro-ROS

In the case of the new version of ROS, ROS 2, there was not a solution for such microcontroller-robot integrations.
But there is a project called micro-ROS bringing ROS2 to microcontrollers.
One of the capabilities of micro-ROS is the use of serial connexion between a microcontroller and a ROS2 capable computer.
Such a connection is possible thanks to the use of OMG's DDS-XRCE standard and a serial transport layer.
Micro-ROS solution follows the same client-server architecture as rosserial, as it is one of the most suitable architectural approaches when we speak of microcontroller communications.

This approach uses the concept of client-agent communication.
In this specific case, clients generate entities within the agent which will act on behalf of the clients on a DDS network (as ROS 2 has drifted into using DDS networks instead of the original ROS network).

This usage, as you can see, resembles the one used by rosserial, but they have subtle differences in their implementations which we will expose in this article.

## micro-ROS vs rosserial

Now that we have a quick view of rosserial and micro-ROS we will go on a comparison between them.

### micro-ROS (over Serial Transport)

micro-ROS, when communicating over serial transports (it allows communications over other transports such as UDP, TCP ...), uses a serial protocol with a predefined format.
This format is explained in the following frame dissection:

```
0        8        16       24                40                 X                 X+16
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------//--------+--------+--------+
| FLAG   |  SADD  |  RADD  |       LEN       |     PAYLOAD      |       CRC       |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------//--------|--------+--------+
```

* `FLAG`: synchronization flag (0xFF).
* `SADD`: source address.
* `RADD`: remote address.
* `LEN`: payload length without framing (2 bytes in little-endian).
* `PAYLOAD`: serialised message with XRCE headers.
* `CRC`: message CRC after stuffing.

This is the message that is serialised on the link layer.
This is the message going from an towards the microcontroller thanks to two different operations: publish and subscribe.

## rosserial

In contrast, this is the rosserial frame:

```
0       8       16              32              40      56               X             X+16
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------//-------+------+------+
| FLAG  | PROT  |      LEN      |      LCRC     | TOPID |     PAYLOAD    |     MCRC    |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------//-------|------+------+
```

* `FLAG`: synchronization flag (0xFF).
* `PROT`: protocol version.
* `LEN`: payload length (2 bytes in little-endian).
* `LCRC`: length CRC.
* `TOPID`: topic ID.
* `PAYLOAD`: serialised message.
* `MCRC`: message CRC.

As you can see comparing with the micro-ROS serial frame, it uses a completely different frame.

## Comparison

The following table, summarises the key aspects of both implmentations:

| | micro-ROS-serial | rosserial |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| **ROS** | ROS 2 | ROS |
| **API** | C/C++ | C++ |
| **integrity** | [HDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Data_Link_Control) framing | none |
| **security** | [CRC-16-CCITT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) | vague CRC (% 256) |
| **memcopy** | uxr_stream ---> serial_buffer ---> hardware_buffer | serialization_buffer ---> hardware_buffer |
| **memory usage** | uxr_stream + (2 * aux-buffer[42 B]) | 2 * serialization_buffer |
| **message size limit** | uxr_stream size | hardware_buffer size |
| **reliability** | yes | no |
| **routing** | yes | no |
| **overhead** | 7 B + 12 B* | 9 B |
| **architecture** | client-server | client-server |

_* Overhead is divided between framing, 7 B and that added by DDS-XRCE protocol 12 B._

As exposed in this table, micro-ROS serial increases the number of memory operations but reduces in a great way the memory required for serial communications as it does not require a that the hardware buffer has the same size as the serialisation buffer.
This use of buffers reduces memory usage.
Also, the micro-ROS provide routing and reliability capabilities in contrast with rosserial.
micro-ROS protocol embraces standards for some of its parts, like the usage of standard CRC or a standard framing.
