[micro-ROS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/213167_en.html) puts ROS2 onto microcontrollers, making them first class participants of the ROS 2 environment.

## Tutorials

See [Tutorial List](/docs/tutorials/).

## Architecture

We're basically following the ROS2 architecture and make use of its middleware pluggability to use [DDS-XRCE](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-XRCE/), which is suitable for microcontrollers. Moreover, we use an RTOS (NuttX) instead of Linux. On microcontrollers many different RTOS's are used, so we also add an RTOS abstraction layer (AL), to make porting to other RTOS possible.
