## Introduction

The aim of this section is to be able of running micro-ROS architecture examples using Docker files at one of the supported embedded boards.

For that purpose, we are going to use a [Olimex STM32-E407](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/open-source-hardware) board, that contains and Cortex-M4F microcontroller.


## Running micro-ROS example

At this example, we are going to flash the board with a binary that contains a NuttX App. This NuttX App is a micro-ROS client. This client will try to connect to the micro-ROS Agent running at your computer and exchange data using Micro XRCE-DDS.

For that purpose, firs install [this](https://github.com/micro-ROS/docker/tree/pre_refactor/Embedded/NuttX/precompiled/micro-ROS/olimex_stm32-e407) container at your Linux machine.



Build the container and compile ready to work `micro XRCE-DDS` with a subscriber and a publisher for the `OLIMEX STM32-E407` board:
```bash
docker build -t microros_uxdf4 .
```
Access the container with privileges so that we can flash the board from within:
```bash
docker run -it -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb --privileged microros_uxdf4 /bin/bash
```
Flash the board:
```bash
# inside the docker container
cd nuttx
./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407
```
if successful, you should see something like this:


```

## Running Micro XRCE-DDS example

In this case, instead of running the complete micro-ROS stuck, we will run a DDS level example. For that purpose, the embedded board will execute a Micro XRCE-DDS example that will communicate with an Agent that is running in your Linux machine.

First of all, downlod the [Docker machine](https://github.com/micro-ROS/docker/blob/pre_refactor/Embedded/NuttX/precompiled/micro-ROS/olimex_stm32-e407/Dockerfile) containing all the tools. Along with all the dependencies, this image contains micro-ROS publish/subscribe pre-built examples ready to flash and run on the board.

## Build

There are two options to get the image.

1. Build your own the image using the docker file:

    ```bash
    docker build -t microros_stm32f4 .
    ```

1. Pull the image from DockerHub.
    ```bash
    docker pull microros/stm32-e407
    ```

## Run

Access the container with privileges so that we can flash the board from within:

```bash
docker run -it -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb --privileged microros/stm32-e407 /bin/bash
```

 Flash the board:

```bash
# inside the docker container
cd nuttx
openocd -f interface/ftdi/olimex-arm-usb-tiny-h.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg -c init -c "reset halt" -c "flash write_image erase nuttx.bin 0x08000000"
```

if successful, you should see something like this:

```bash
.

Info : flash size = 1024kbytes
wrote 65536 bytes from file nuttx.bin in 2.157869s (29.659 KiB/s)

```

At this point, you should have your board flashed with NuttX image containing an `nsh` application and a publisher and a subscriber using Micro XRCE-DDS.
