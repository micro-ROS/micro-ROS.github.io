## Supported Configurations

| Host OS  | Version  | ROS Version  |  Status | 
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Ubuntu   | 18.04.   | Crystal      |  Supported, see [Installation](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ros-build/blob/crystal/micro_ros_setup/README.md) |   |
| Ubuntu   | 18.04.   | Dashing      |  TODO |

If you manage to install on a different version, please [open an issue](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ros-build/issues/new) with information, and we'll add the info here!

For Ubuntu 16.04., the main issue is that there are no pre-built ROS 2 Crystal packages available. If you build ROS 2 from source, it should be possible to also get micro-ROS running there.
