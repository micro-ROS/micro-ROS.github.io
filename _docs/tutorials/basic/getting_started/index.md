## Introduction

The aim of this section is to be able of running micro-ROS architecture examples using Docker files at your computer, without the need of any embedded board.


## Running micro-ROS example at Docker using prebuilt Docker {#micro-ROS-prebuilt-Docker}

_Explain how to set up and run, @BorjaOuterelo need your help here_

It makes sense having just one Docker file containing micro-ROS Agent and client? I think so

At docker repo, we have one folder for each.

## Running rclc and rclcpp examples in your ROS 2 workspace {#rclc-rclcpp-ROS2-ws}

There are also available examples that you could run building the code at your Linux or Windows computer.

### Previous step

To run all the demonstrations, you need to set up the ROS 2 environment and build all the required packages.
Click [here](https://github.com/microROS/micro-ROS-doc) to read further about how to do this previous step.

### Package clusters

The repository contains the below packages clusters:

#### Simple message demonstration

##### Packages

###### Int32_publisher

The purpose of the package is to publish one of the most basic ROS 2 messages and demonstrate how Micro-ROS layers (rcl, typesupport and rmw) handle it.
For each publication, the message value increases in one unit order to see in the subscriber side the message variations.

###### Int32_subscriber

The purpose of the package is to subscribe to one of the most basic ROS 2 messages and demonstrate how Micro-ROS layers (rcl, typesupport and rmw) handle it.

##### Run demonstration (Linux)

Run the micro-ROS Agent.
For the micro-ROS Agent to find the XML reference file, the execution must be done from the executable folder.

```bash
cd ~/agent_ws/install/uros_agent/lib/uros_agent/
./uros_agent udp 8888
```

You may prefer to run the Agent in the background and discard all outputs to keep using the same terminal for the next step.

```bash
cd ~/agent_ws/install/uros_agent/lib/uros_agent/
./uros_agent udp 8888 > /dev/null &
```

Run the publisher.

```bash
~/client_ws/install/int32_publisher_c/lib/int32_publisher_c/./int32_publisher_c
```

You may prefer to run the publisher in the background and discard all outputs to keep using the terminal for the next step.

```bash
 ~/client_ws/install/int32_publisher_c/lib/int32_publisher_c/./int32_publisher_c > /dev/null &
```

Run the subscriber.

```bash
~/client_ws/install/int32_subscriber_c/lib/int32_subscriber_c/./int32_subscriber_c

#### String message demonstration

##### String packages

###### String_publisher

- All primitive data types.
- Nested message data.
- Unbonded string data.

#### Real application demonstration

This purpose of the packages is to demonstrate Micro-ROS stack can be used in a real application scenario.
In this demonstration, an altitude control system is simulated.
The primary purpose of this is to demonstrate how Micro-ROS communicates with ROS 2 nodes.

##### Real application packages

###### rad0_actuator

The mission of this node is to simulate a dummy engine power actuator.
It receives power increments and publishes the total power amount as a DDS topic.

The node is built using the Micro-ROS middleware packages (rmw_micro_xrcedds and rosidl_typesupport_microxrcedds).

It is meant to be running in a microcontroller processor, but for this demonstration, the node runs on the host PC.
The node is connected to the DDS world through a Micro XRCE-DDS Agent.

###### rad0_altitude_sensor

The mission of this node is to simulate a dummy altitude sensor.
It publishes the altitude variations as a DDS topic.

The node is built using the Micro-ROS middleware packages (rmw_micro_xrcedds and rosidl_typesupport_microxrcedds).

It is meant to be running in a microcontroller processor, but for this demonstration, the node runs on the host PC.
The node is connected to the DDS world through a Micro XRCE-DDS Agent.

###### rad0_control

The mission of this node is to read altitude values and send to the actuator engine variations.
It also publishes the status (OK, WARNING or FAILURE) as a DDS topic.
The status depends on the altitude value.

The node is built using the ROS 2 middleware packages (rmw_fastrtps and rosidl_typesupport_fastrtps).

It is meant to be running in on a regular PC, and it is directly connected to de DDS world.

###### rad0_display

The mission of this node is to simulate one LCD screen that prints the critical parameters.
It subscribes to the altitude, power and status messages available as a DDS topic.

The node is built using the Micro-ROS middleware packages (rmw_micro_xrcedds and rosidl_typesupport_microxrcedds).

It is meant to be running in a microcontroller processor, but for this demonstration, the node runs on the host PC.
The node is connected to the DDS world through a Micro XRCE-DDS Agent.
