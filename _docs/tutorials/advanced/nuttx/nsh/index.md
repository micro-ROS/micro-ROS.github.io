NSH is a system console that can be used through different interfaces.
In this tutorial, we will show how to use it over the UART and USB peripherals.

## Hardware requirements:

- [Olimex-STM32-E407 board](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/open-source-hardware)
- [JTAG Flasher device](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-USB-TINY/)
- USB-TTL232 cable.
- Mini USB cable.

## Create the firmware

For this tutorial we are going to execute the following configuration in micro_ros_setup:

```bash
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh nuttx olimex-stm32-e407
# For UART
ros2 run micro_ros_setup configure_firmware.sh nsh_uart
# For USB
ros2 run micro_ros_setup configure_firmware.sh nsh
```

Once the board is configured, we need to build it by typing the command:

```bash
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh
```

If the compilation succeeds, it should return this output:
```bash
CP: nuttx.hex
CP: nuttx.bin
```

# Flash the firmware

The firmware is ready, it is just necessary to upload it.
Now you need to do the following connections:
- Connect the JTAG flasher device.
- Connect the USB TTL-232 to the USART3 in case of UART communication:
  - `USART3 TX` -> `TTL232 RX`
  - `USART3 RX` -> `TTL232 TX`
  - `GND Board` -> `TTL232 GND`

- Connect the mini USB to the OTG2 for USB communication.

Now flash the board by typing the next command:
```bash
ros2 run micro_ros_setup flash_firmware.sh
```

This should return this output once the process is finished:

```bash
wrote 49152 bytes from file nuttx.bin in 6.279262s (7.644 KiB/s)
Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections
```

## Connect to the console

Finally, to use the NSH console you need to follow the steps listed below:
- Push the reset button. The green LED will turn on to say that it is working properly.
- Look for the device by typing `dmesg` on the console, this should return something like this:

```bash
# For UART

# For USB

[20614.746277] cdc_acm: USB Abstract Control Model driver for USB modems and ISDN adapters
```
In this specific situation, the device is assigned to `dev/ttyUSB0` and `dev/ttyACM0` for UART and USB communication respectively. Note that the last number could be different.

Finally, execute the next command to open the NSH console:
```
# For UART
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

# For USB
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
```

Once the port is opened, **you need to push two times the Enter key** and it should show the next menu:

```bash
nsh> ?
help usage:  help [-v] [<cmd>]

  ?           exec        hexdump     mb          sleep       
  cat         exit        kill        mh          usleep      
  echo        help        ls          mw          xd
