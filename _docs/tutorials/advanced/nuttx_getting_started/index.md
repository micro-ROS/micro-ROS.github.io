# Repositories to be used

For the examples listed below, please make use of the branch called `master` for this two repositories:

-  [NuttX](https://github.com/microROS/Nuttx) fork, where NuttX RTOS is stored.
-  [Apps](https://github.com/microROS/apps) fork, whee NuttX applications and examples are placed.

----------------------

# How to configure and flash a board

We have developed two scripts that will help you to configure and flash the board. Go to the `NuttX` folder and write the next commands:

- To configure: `$ ./scripts/configure.sh <board_model> <example_to_set>`
- To compile: `make`
- To flash: `./scripts/flash.sh <board_model>`, where the script expects `olimex-stm32-e407` or `stm32l1`.

The configuration script will clean the previous project and set the new configuration.

The flash script will execute the proper command to upload the firmware to the board and execute it. The use of `OpenOCD` gives you the chance to debug the MCU.

# Step-by-step tutorials

This section provides step-by-step tutorials so you can start executing the examples we have created. These tutorials starts using NuttX, using many different peripherals and tools, and ends up showing how to execute Micro XRCE-DDS client and micro-ROS client.

## How to execute NSH over USB under Olimex-STM32-E407

NSH is a system console that can be use throught the next interfaces: USB,UART and Telnet. With this console you can execute apps, set system configuration and see the state of the system.

Go to the main folder of NuttX and execute the next command to configure the board:
`./scripts/configure.sh olimex-stm32-e407 nsh`

This script will clean NuttX and set the configuration that we need. You should see something like this at the end of process at the terminal.

```
  Copy files
  Refreshing...
```

Once the board is configured, the next step will be to compile the firmware:
Type `make` and you should see something like this when it finishes in the terminal:
```
CP: nuttx.hex
CP: nuttx.bin
```

Now it's ready for uploading the firmware into the board, so plug the micro USB cable an type the next command:
`./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407`

If everything goes right, the loader will return the next message:
```
wrote 49152 bytes from file nuttx.bin in 6.279262s (7.644 KiB/s)
Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections
```

Connect the mini USB cable to the USB OTG1

![img](imgs/olimex_nsh_usb.jpg)

Open a new terminal and use a serial client, i.e. `minicom` to open the serial port, `sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0`. Once done, you should be able to see how `NSH` pops up when pressing key:

```
nsh>
nsh>
nsh>
nsh> ?
help usage:  help [-v] [<cmd>]

  ?           exec        hexdump     mb          sleep       
  cat         exit        kill        mh          usleep      
  echo        help        ls          mw          xd          

Builtin Apps:
nsh>
```
If you don't know which interface is the micro USB, type `dmesg` command at a terminal, this command should let you know which is the last USB device that has been connected to your computer and at what interface is attached.

## How to execute NSH with the UART.


### Olimex-STM32-E407
This board have the possibility to show the console through the UART or through USB.

Go to the main folder of NuttX and execute the next command to configure the board:
`./scripts/configure.sh olimex-stm32-e407 nsh_uart`

This script will clean NuttX and set the configuration that we need. You should see something like this at the end of process at the terminal.

```
  Copy files
  Refreshing...
```
Once the board is configured, the next step will be to compile the firmware:
Type `make` and you should see something like this when it finishes in the terminal:
```
CP: nuttx.hex
CP: nuttx.bin
```
Now it's ready for uploading the firmware into the board, so plug the micro USB cable an type the next command:
`./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407`

If everything goes right, the loader will return the next message:
```

Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections
```
For this demo we need to connect a USB cable to the mini USB port and a serial cable (TTL232) to the UART3 with the next pinout:

- `USART3 TX` -> `TTL232 RX`
- `USART3 RX` -> `TTL232 TX`
- `GND Board` -> `TTL232 GND`

It should look like this:
![img](imgs/olimex_nsh_uart.jpg)

Open a new terminal and use a serial client, i.e. `minicom` to open the serial port, `sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0`. Once done, you should be able to see how `NSH` pops up when pressing key:

```
nsh>
nsh>
nsh>
nsh> ?
help usage:  help [-v] [<cmd>]

  ?           exec        hexdump     mb          sleep       
  cat         exit        kill        mh          usleep      
  echo        help        ls          mw          xd          

Builtin Apps:
nsh>
```


### STM32L1Discovery
**This board only can show the NSH console throught the UART**

Go to the main folder of NuttX and execute the next command to configure the board:
`./scripts/configure.sh stm32l1 nsh`

This script will clean NuttX and set the configuration that we need. You should see something like this at the end of process at the terminal.

```
  Copy files
  Refreshing...
```

Once the board is configured, the next step will be to compile the firmware:
Type `make` and you should see something like this when it finishes in the terminal:
```
CP: nuttx.hex
CP: nuttx.bin
```

Now it's ready for uploading the firmware into the board, so plug the micro USB cable an type the next command:
`./scripts/flash.sh stm32l1`

If everything goes right, the loader will return the next message:
```
wrote 49152 bytes from file nuttx.bin in 6.279262s (7.644 KiB/s)
Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections
```

Connect the serial cable `RX` to pin `PA9` and `TX` to pin `PA10` and the GND wire to a `GND` pin.

![img](imgs/l1.jpg)

Open a new terminal and use a serial client, i.e. `minicom` to open the serial port, `sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0`. Once done, you should be able to see how `NSH` pops up when pressing key:

```
nsh>

  ?           exec        hexdump     mb          sleep       
  cat         exit        kill        mh          usleep      
  echo        help        ls          mw          xd          

Builtin Apps:
nsh>
```
If you don't know which interface is the micro USB, type `dmesg` command at a terminal, this command should let you know which is the last USB device that has been connected to your computer and at what interface is attached.

## How to use an auxiliary UART:

In this demo we will show how to use an auxiliary UART to send and receive messages.
When we run this demos, we will send the first argument to the auxiliary terminal and we will wait for an input from the auxiliary terminal.

*Note: The STM32L1Discovery board can use a auxiliary port, but the application it's not compatible.*

You need to configure, compile and upload the firmware, so execute the next commands:
- `./scripts/configure.sh olimex-stm32-e407 aux_serial`
- `make`
- `./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407`

For this demo we need to connect a USB cable to the mini USB port and a serial cable (TTL232) to the UART3 with the next pinout:

- `USART3 TX` -> `TTL232 RX`
- `USART3 RX` -> `TTL232 TX`
- `GND Board` -> `TTL232 GND`

And it should look like this:

![image](imgs/olimex_uxd.jpg)

Start the board, find which is the port of the auxiliary serial cable and open a terminal in that port. Init the application `aux_serial <message_to_send>`.

The message will appear in the other terminal and you need to push any key in the terminal to unlock the board console. This image is the board console:

![image](imgs/aux_board.png)

This image is the auxiliary console:

## How to execute UDP Echo server example

Go to the main folder of NuttX and type the next command to configure the board:
`./scripts/configure.sh olimex-stm32-e407 udpecho`

Compile:
`make`

Upload:
`./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407`

This print the next:

- Configuration:
```
Copy files
Refreshing...
```
- Compilation:
```
CP: nuttx.hex
CP: nuttx.bin
```
- Upload the firmware
```

Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections
```

Once the code it's uploaded to the board, do the next:
- Connect the ethernet cable to the ethernet port of the board.
- Connect the mini USB cable to the USB_OTG 1 port.


![img_20180903_101218_026](imgs/olimex_ethernet.jpg)


- Configure the console with a baud rate of 115200 bauds.
- Once you open the console, you should check if the app was correctly upload typing `?`. You should see the next:
![image](imgs/udp_1.jpg)

- Then type `ifup eth0` to bring up the network:
![image](imgs/udp_2.jpg)

- Mount the file system of NuttX typing `mount -t procfs /proc`
- See which IP was assigned to your board typing `ifconfig` and you should see this:
![image](imgs/udp_3.jpg)

With this command, you can see statistics of the network, the IP of the board, the state of the connection...
In this case the IP that was assigned was the 192.168.1.35
**By default this board will use the port 80.** To change it, you must do it in the app's code.

- The last step in the board side is to type `udpecho` to run the udp echo server.
-Then in the computer side, use `netcat` command.  Type the next command: `netcat -u 192.168.1.35 80`

Now if you type something in the computer, the board should echo the same and show the data of the messages, like in the image:

**Computer side**

Once the code it's uploaded to the board, do the next steps:
- Connect the ethernet cable to the ethernet port of the board.
- Connect the mini USB cable to the USB_OTG 1 port.

*Note:This example has been made using router in the middle of the computer and the Olimex board.*

Once you reset the board, it should appear the NSH console and, if you type  `?`, you should see the `tcpecho` application.

![image](imgs/tcp_1.jpg)

You need to bring up the network:

![image](imgs/udp_2.jpg)

Type `ifconfig` and you will see the IP.

![image](imgs/udp_3.jpg)

Finally execute the app, it should return the next:
```
Start Echo Server

```

Then, in your computer, you can open an TCP/IP client with the next command in the console:
` netcat -t 192.168.1.133 80`

This command connects to the IP 192.168.1.133 and to the port 80

Now wright some characters in the terminal:

```
~$ netcat -t 192.168.1.133 80
sfd
sfd
aaa
aaa
jjj
jjj
```

At the client, in your computer, you should see the reply of what you're writing.

If you want to check or modify the connection data, you can do it in the next path:
`make menuconfig`

`Application configuration`

`Examples`

And you will see something like this:

![image](imgs/tcp.jpg)

This shows the IP direction, the netmask and the router IP in hexadecimal format and the port to connect.

The variables are shown in two hexadecimal numbers per each field. In case of the IP:
`0xCA` = 192

`0xA8` = 168

`0x01` = 1

`0x85` = 133


## How to use MRF24j40-6LowPan

With this demo, we'll be able to create a point to point connection with the  MRF24J40 module using the protocol 6LowPan. This network, allows you to have hundreds of nodes with very little power consumption.
One of the nodes is a TCP or UDP server, and the other nodes are TCP or UDP clients that they connect to the server.

[mrf24j40 breakout link](https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-rf2-ieee-802-15-rf-transceiver/)

Go to the main folder of NuttX and type the command to configure the board:
`./scripts/configure.sh olimex-stm32-e407 mrf24j40-6lowpan`

Compile:
`make`

Upload:
`./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407`

It should return somenthing like this:

- Configuration:
```
Copy files
Refreshing...
```
- Compilation:
```
CP: nuttx.hex
CP: nuttx.bin
```
- Upload the firmware
```
wrote 131072 bytes from file nuttx.bin in 3.763846s (34.008 KiB/s)
Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections
```
(The number of written bytes could be different in each board)

Once the firmware was configured and uploaded, we need to connect the breakout board like this:
- `Board D13` -> `MRF24J40 SCLK`
- `Board D12` -> `MRF24J40 MISO`
- `Board D11` -> `MRF24J40 MOSI`
- `Board D10` -> `MRF24J40 CS`
- `Board D8` -> `MRF24J40 INT`

Finally, connect the mini USB cable to the USB OTG1, and the connections should look like this:

![image](imgs/olimex_mrf24j40.jpg)

Once the wiring is done, open a console and you should see this:

![image](imgs/6lowpan_nsh.png)

First we need to type the next command in both boards to bring-down the connection: `ifdown wpan0`

We already know that we have two different roles, **Client** and **Server**. So we need to configure each board with one role:
**- Server Configuration:**
- `i8sak wpan0 startpan cd:ab `
- `i8sak set chan 11`
- `i8sak set panid cd:ab `
- `i8sak set saddr 42:01 `
- `i8sak acceptassoc  `

Now it's time to configure the client. It's important to follow this configuration order.
**- Client Configuration:**
- `i8sak wpan0`
- `i8sak set chan 11 `
- `i8sak set panid cd:ab `
- `i8sak set saddr 42:02  `
- `i8sak set ep_saddr 42:01`
- `i8sak assoc`

If everything goes fine, you should see something like this:
**Server Board**

![image](imgs/6lowpan_accept.png)

**Client Board**

![image](imgs/6lowpan_assoc.png)

It is only left to bring-up the network, so type this command in both boards: `ifup wpan0`.

At this point, the set-up is complete and it's the moment to use the UDP server and client to have a communication between the boards.
So, first we need to know the IP of the server board. Type the next commands in the server board:
- `mount -t procfs /proc`
- `ifconfig`

You should see something like in the image. The red square is the IP of the board.
![image](imgs/6lowpan_ip.png)

Finally in the Server board, execute the Server, typing:
- `udpserver &`

![image](imgs/6lowpan_server.png)
Now the UDP server, it's ready to work.

To use the UDP client, we need to type the next command in the client board:
- `udpclient <IP of the server board>`

![image](imgs/6lowpan_client.png)

Now the UDP Client, will send a `HelloWorld` to the UDP Server.



## How to use the ADC demo

In this demo we will take the analog value pin A1, that is attached to  channel 4 of the ADC number 3. This demo only works in the Olimex board.

First we need to configure, compile and upload the firmware:

- `./scripts/configure.sh olimex-stm32-e407 adc`

To compile:
- `make`

To upload:
- `./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407`

For this demo it's only necessary to connect a minim USB cable to the USB-OTG 1 port, to see the console.
Once you run the console, you should see this apps:

![image](imgs/adc_nsh.png)

If you execute the application typing `adc_simple`, you will see a measurement of the A1 pin every 100ms like in the image:

![image](imgs/adc_measure.png)

# How to execute CPU performance telemetry app

Go to the main folder of NuttX and type the next command to configure the board:
`./scripts/configure.sh olimex-stm32-e407 telemetry`

Compile:
`make`

Upload:
`./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407`

This print the next:

- Configuration:
```
Copy files
Refreshing...
```
- Compilation:
```
CP: nuttx.hex
CP: nuttx.bin
```
- Upload the firmware
```

```

Once the code it's uploaded to the board, do the next:
- Connect the mini USB cable to the USB_OTG 1 port.

When you reset the board, yo should see this app:

```
NuttShell (NSH)

nsh>
```

The App, will perform the next tests:
## CPU Performance test:
This test is to show the percentage of CPU usage under heavy floating operations.
We have the variable 'e' which have the value of the first digits of Pi. So we will do the next operations 100000 times: 'e'='e'*'e'.
This unit doesn't have a DSP unit, so the floating point operations have a high cost for the CPU.
This test could also use as a benchmark to compare different MCUs.

```
nsh> telemetry

## Info of a running App:
In this last test, you can see the priority of an App, the scheduling algorithm, what it is (a task or a thread) and the state:
```
Status of the running task

If you run this command: `cat /proc/self/status `, you will see that the task has changed, and scheduling algorithm.
```

# How to execute Power Manager example

This example is simple. After some seconds, the board enter into a sleep mode that could be re-waken up, writing into the serial season. As the MCU is in low power mode, some data is lost, until the complete wake up is done.

### Olimex STM32-E407

Go to the main folder of NuttX and type the command to configure the board:
`./scripts/configure.sh olimex-stm32-e407 pm`

Compile:
`make`

Upload:
`./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407`

### STM32L Discovery

Go to the main folder of NuttX and type the command to configure the board:
`./scripts/configure.sh stm32l1 pm`

Compile:
`make`

Upload the firmware:
`./scripts/flash.sh stm32l1`

In both cases, it should return at the end something like this:
- Configuration:
```
Copy files
Refreshing...
```
- Compilation:
```
CP: nuttx.hex
CP: nuttx.bin
```
- Upload the firmware
```

Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections
```
(The number of writen bytes could be different in each board)

Now open a serial session for connecting to the board. Once the prompt pops-up, do not type for some seconds and you will see that, in a point, if you type something, it will not appear at the command line. After some seconds, the command line will again work properly.


## How to use a micro SD-Card in the Olimex-STM32-E407 board

This demo it's only for the Olimex board. This demo shows how to write and read files from a SD card.

To configure type the next command in the main folder of NuttX:
- `./scripts/configure.sh olimex-stm32-e407 sd`

Compile it:
- `make`

Upload the firmware to the board:
- `./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407`

This demo doesn't require any special wiring, only connect the mini-USB cable to the USB-OTG port and introduce the SD-Card before power on the board.
This board doesn't have automatic detection of insertion or extraction of SD-Card.

Once you're in the console, type `ls /dev` to see if the card was register:
![image](imgs/sd_detect.png)

The `mmcsd0` interface is the SD card.

The next step is to mount the file SD-Card file system, so it's necessary to write the next command:
`mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt`

Now the SD Card is ready to use. So you can use the next commands to write something on it:
- See the files available: `ls /mnt`
- Read a file: `cat /mnt/<name_of_the_file>`
- Write or createa file: `echo "Content to write" > /mnt/name_of_your_file`

## How to execute Micro XRCE-DDS

In this example, we will execute Micro XRCE-DDS client in NuttX. This example runs a shape demo.
For this demo we need two boards (It doesn't matter if it's the Olimex Board or the STM32L1), one will be the publisher which will send a topic with a shape, the color of the shape and the coordinate of the shape. The other board will subscribe to the topic.
At this moment it's only possible to work through serial, but it could be possible to use with UDP and TCP in a future.

### Olimex STM32-E407

Go to the main folder of NuttX and type the command to configure the board:
`./scripts/configure.sh olimex-stm32-e407 microxrcedds`

Compile:
`make`

Upload:
`./scripts/flash.sh olimex-stm32-e407`

### STM32L Discovery

Go to the main folder of NuttX and type the command to configure the board:
`./scripts/configure.sh stm32l1 microxrcedds`

Compile:
`make`

Upload the firmware:
`./scripts/flash.sh stm32l1`

In both cases it should return at the end something like this:
- Configuration:
```
Copy files
Refreshing...
```
- Compilation:
```
CP: nuttx.hex
CP: nuttx.bin
```
- Upload the firmware
```
wrote 131072 bytes from file nuttx.bin in 3.763846s (34.008 KiB/s)
Info : Listening on port 6666 for tcl connections
Info : Listening on port 4444 for telnet connections
```
(The number of wrote bytes could be different in each board)

At this point the board is ready to work, and we need to attach the next cables:

### Olimex STM32-E407

Connect the micro USB to the USB-OTG1 to have access to the console.
Then we need to connect to the USART3, so follow this diagram:
- `USART3 TX` -> `TTL232 RX`
- `USART3 RX` -> `TTL232 TX`
- `GND Board` -> `TTL232 GND`

And it should look like this:
![image](imgs/olimex_uxd.jpg)

### STM32LDiscovery

For this board we need two TTL232 cables. The first one is used to show the console.
Connect the serial cable `RX` to pin `PA9` and `TX` to pin `PA10` and the GND wire to a `GND` pin.

Then, you need to connect to the second UART to use micro-XRCE-DDS:
Connect the serial cable `RX` to pin `PA2` and `TX` to pin `PA3` and the GND wire to a `GND` pin.

And it should look like this:
![image](imgs/l1_uxd.jpg)


In this example, we use an Olimex board and a STM32L1 Board, but you can use any combination between STM32L1, Olimex Board and PC. Now we're going to execute the Agent in the PC.
First, we need to check the port number of the serial cable that we want to use as Micro XRCE-DDS interface.
Note: You must installed micro-XRCE-DDS agent previously, follow this guide -> https://micro-xrce-dds.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

Open a console and type the next command:
`MicroXRCE-DDSAgent serial <serial_port>`

If you're using the Olimex Board you need to type the command in the console:
`client --serial /dev/ttyS0`
Otherwise, if you using the STM32LDiscovery board, you need to use this command:
`client --serial /dev/ttyS1`

Now to set a board as **Publisher**, you need to use the next commands:
```
create_session
create_participant 1
create_topic 1 1
create_publisher 1 1
create_datawriter 1 1
```

If you want to be **Subscriber** you need to use the next commands:
```
create_session
create_participant 1
create_topic 1 1
create_subscriber 1 1
create_datareader 1 1
```

To publish a topic, you need to write this command:
```
 write_data 1 128 200 200 40 BLUE
 ```

To receive a data in the subscriber, you need to write this command:
```
request_data 1 128 1
```

You can find more detailed information on this page:
https://micro-xrce-dds.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Important note: For each client that you want to run, you need to run an agent in PC.
For example:
We have the STM32L1 as publisher, so we need to check the serial port number of the Micro XRCE-DDS serial interface and run an Agent in the PC.
Then, we have the Olimex as subscriber, so we need to follow the same steps as with the STM32L1 board.


## How to use  micro-ROS demo:

In this demo, we will use the alpha version of microROS for NuttX running under the Olimex-STM32-E407 board.
With board running this demo we could create a ROS2 publisher or a ROS2 subscriber.
The publisher creates and publishes as a topic a progressive count of integers (From 0 to 1000).
The subscriber subscribes to that topic and shows the value of the number published.

This demo is a little bit different as the other demos because we need to follow another path to configure it.
We need to download the docker files of micro-ROS, executing the next command:
`git clone -b features/micro-ros https://github.com/microROS/docker`
(Note: This repository might change of location)

Now it's necessary to build the docker file, so type the next command:
`docker build -t microros_stm32f4 .`
If everything goes right, you should run this command to start the docker:
`docker build -t microros_stm32f4 `

At this point it only left to upload the precompile firmware to the board, typing the next commands:
`cd nuttx`
`openocd -f interface/ftdi/olimex-arm-usb-tiny-h.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg -c init -c "reset halt" -c "flash write_image erase nuttx.bin 0x08000000"`

Once the firmware is ready and uploaded, you need to connect the miniUSB cable to the USB-OTG1 and connect the serial cable(TTL232) to USART3 with the next pinout:
- `USART3 TX` -> `TTL232 RX`
- `USART3 RX` -> `TTL232 TX`
- `GND Board` -> `TTL232 GND`

And it should look like this:

![image](imgs/olimex_uxd.jpg)

Now the board it's ready.
Connect the serial cable (TTL232) to the computer and check which is the number of the serial port.

Note: We need to install previously the micro-ROS agent. So you can follow the next guide to install it:
https://github.com/microROS/micro-ROS-doc/blob/master/docs/install_and_run.md

## Run a publisher:

First you need to execute the **microROS Agent** in your computer using the next command:
```
cd ~/agent_ws/install/uros_agent/lib/uros_agent/
./uros_agent serial <direction_of_serial>
```

Once you execute it should look like this:

![image](imgs/microros_agent.png)

Now execute the publisher app in the Olimex board, typing `publisher`, and should send a new value every 100mS. And will look like this:

**Agent**

![image](imgs/microros_agentattach.png)

**Board publisher**

![image](imgs/microros_pub.png)

Finally, if you type in a console `ros2 topic list`, you will be able to see the topic like in the image:

## Run a publisher:


To run this example, you should follow the same steps as in the previous (Run a publisher), instead of run the `publisher` app, you should run `subscriber` app.

If the publisher is running properly, you should see this on the board:

So as a summary:
- With this demo, you can run a publisher or subscriber in the Olimex Board.
- You need to run an agent for each publisher or subscriber that you want to run.
- You can create a ROS2 subscriber in the PC and receive the topic.
- The topic that sends this example is an integer that goes from 0 to 1000.
