Rare is the program that works on the first try -- so you will usually need a debugger. This is even more true on an embedded device, where "printf"-style debugging is very cumbersome.

There are many tools for embedded debugging. This tutorial will show you how to debug on the command line, using the [GNU Debugger gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) and the [Open On-Chip Debugger, OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/). These two open source tools are readily available on Linux, and they form the basis for many more advanced tools, including graphical debuggers.

NuttX integration for OpenOCD is relatively new as of the time of writing (early 2019), so this tutorial also includes instructions on how to get and configure it.

## Pre-Requisites

### Hardware

 * a [supported embedded board](/docs/hardware_support#evaluation-boards)
 * a [support debugger probe](/docs/hardware_support#development-tools)

### Software

 * a NuttX development setup, including gdb
 * OpenOCD-Nuttx (but we will show to install that)


## Install OpenOCD-Nuttx

Sony has added NuttX support to OpenOCD, and most importantly, this includes thread info. Since NuttX is a real RTOS with support multiple tasks/threads, you need thread support to look at anything other than the currently active task.

### Get the code

The repository is on Github at [https://github.com/sony/openocd-nuttx](https://github.com/sony/openocd-nuttx). Check it out like this:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sony/openocd-nuttx
```
(the '--depth 1' is not required, but it saves you from downloading unnecessary data)

Do *not* compile openocd just yet!

### Determine your NuttX configuration

NuttX sometimes switches around the memory location of the necessary information, so we need to configure OpenOCD for the currently used NuttX version.

Put the following into your `.gdbinit`:
```
define print-offset
 printf "#define PID  %p\n",&((struct tcb_s *)(0))->pid
 printf "#define XCPREG  %p\n",&((struct tcb_s *)(0))->xcp.regs
 printf "#define STATE %p\n",&((struct tcb_s *)(0))->task_state
 printf "#define NAME %p\n",&((struct tcb_s *)(0))->name
 printf "#define NAME_SIZE %d\n",sizeof(((struct tcb_s *)(0))->name)
end
```

Then run gdb on your nuttx binary and run this function:
```
arm-none-eabi-gdb nuttx
(gdb) print-offset
```
On Nuttx 7.27, the result should look something like this:
![gdb print offset output](/img/tutorials/gdb-print-offset.png)
The interesting bits are the `#define` statements at the end,

Now open `openocd-nuttx/src/nuttx_header.h` in your favor editor, locate the existing `#define` lines
and replace them with what you got. The result should be like this:

### Configure OpenOCD for NuttX support

OpenOCD has a set of target configurations for the various boards. Since the boards could run one of many RTOS's, the default configuration doesn't specify any particular one -- so we have to add it.

When using the Olimex STM32-E407 board, one of our standard boards, the target configuration file is `stm32f4x.cfg` and it is normally located in `tcl/target/`. For your hardware, it might be a different file, so be sure to use the right one.

Open the target configuration and locate a line starting with `$_TARGETNAME configure`. Then add `-rtos nuttx` to this line.

### Compile OpenOCD

**NOTE** The Sony OpenOCD branch has some compile issues on Ubuntu 18.04 right now, because it uses a newer compiler. The easiest "solution" is to remove the `-Werror` from your compile. We'll submit a patch soon.

To compile and install OpenOCD, after you made your changes, run
```bash
./bootstrap
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### Test OpenOCD

To test OpenOCD, try the following command line:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/ftdi/olimex-arm-usb-ocd-h.cfg -f stm32f4x.cfg -c init -c "reset halt"
```

The output should look as in the following image:
![OpenOCD test output](/img/tutorials/openocd-test.png)

OpenOCD will then block, waiting for a debugger to attach, so lets do that in the next section.

## Running GDB with OpenOCD

Run gdb in your NuttX directory as follows:
```bash
arm-none-eabi-gdb nuttx
(gdb) target extended-remote :3333
(gdb) cont
```
This connected to the gdb server running on port 3333 (OpenOCD default) of the same machine. It will sit on the NuttX `_start` function, which isn't very interesting, so we let it continue.

At this moment we have not defined any breakpoints, yet, so you can just press `Ctrl-C` to interrupt the running program again. This will interrupt it after NuttX had a chance to do initialization, so we will actually get to see some data.

### Inspect the program

Now, if everything worked correctly, we should get some information from the RTOS, such as thread info. To test, type `info threads` at the gdb prompt to get a thread info table. Your output will very depending on the NuttX configuration. On my bare-bones NSH-only configuration, it looks as follows:
![](/img/tutorials/gdb-info-threads.png)
So we see four threads, two of which are the OS work queues, one is the init thread, and one is the idle thread.

Most likely, NuttX has stopped in the idle thread, which isn't very interesting. To inspect the others, we can use the `thread` command to switch a thread and then maybe display a backtrace and some variables. Try the following:

```gdb
thread 2
info locals
print rtcb
print *rtcb
```
This switches to thread 2 and then inspects the local variables, of which there are two, one being called `rtcb`. We print it, see its a pointer to a structure, so we dereference and print again to display all the structure fields. This should look something like the following:
![](/img/tutorials/gdb-print-rtcb.png)
In my case, this is the NSH thread which is waiting for some input.


## Conclusion

This concludes this basic tutorial on getting gdb to run with OpenOCD and NuttX support.

Using gdb on the command line is considered a bit cumbersome by many. So if you know your way
around an IDE with gdb support, integrating it should be easy. We leave that as an exercise
for the reader ;-)

There are also IDEs with microcontroller support -- stay tuned for another tutorial with more
details on that.
