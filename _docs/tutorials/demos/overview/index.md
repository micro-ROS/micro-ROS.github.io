In addition to the above entry-level tutorials, we created a collection of demos that showcase micro-ROS in real applications which are easy to reproduce by the community &mdash; and thus _you_.
Unlike tutorials, we do not explain the demo code step by step, but provide ready-to-use Docker files to get you started as quickly as possible.

Below, you can find a table

<div style="font-size:80%;color:gray;text-align:right;margin-bottom:1em;">*As a matter of course, in addition to the hardware detailed above, you'll need a computer/laptop, various cables, and further auxiliary equipment.</div>

The demos may also interface with the FIWARE Context Broker, which is the core of the [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) open source initiative for context data management. Learn more at [**Interfacing with FIWARE Context Broker**](../fiware_demo/).

Finally, the demos can be combined in several ways to demonstrate further functionalities. Turn to [**Combined Demos**](../combined_demos/) to learn more about these combinations and how to launch them.
