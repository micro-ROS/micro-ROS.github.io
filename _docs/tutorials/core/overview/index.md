This chapter provides the user with a number of tutorials to learn micro-ROS and relevant tools for the different RTOSes supported by micro-ROS. In the [**Advanced Tutorials**](../../advanced/overview/) section, you'll find more advanced tutorials to strenghten your micro-ROS knowledge.

If you are new to micro-ROS, we strongly suggest that you take the tutorials in the following order:

* [**First micro-ROS application on Linux**](../first_application_linux/)

  This tutorial teaches you how to install the micro-ROS framework and tools. Then it will guide you to developed your own first micro-ROS application under Linux. (If you already know ROS 2, you will see that the tools are well integrated with standard ROS 2.)

* [**First micro-ROS application on an RTOS**](../first_application_rtos/)

  In this tutorial, you will learn how to build the application from the previous tutorial for an Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). You will see how to flash a microcontroller board with the application and how to communicate with it from a microprocessor running ROS 2 on Linux. (The tutorial covers all three RTOS supported by micro-ROS, namely NuttX, FreeRTOS, and Zephyr. The choice is up to you!)

* [**Programming with rcl and rclc**](../programming_rcl_rclc/)

  You'll learn the concepts of the micro-ROS C API in this tutorial in depth. If you are already familiar with the ROS 2 C++ API or even the underlying ROS Client Support Library (rcl), you'll learn this very quickly.

* [**Zephyr Emulator**](../zephyr_emulator/)

  In this tutorial, you'll learn the use of micro-ROS with Zephyr emulator by testing a Ping Pong application.
