Micro-ROS brings ROS 2 to microcontrollers. Here, we perform an analysis of the related approaches and eventually show a comparison table.

## ROSSerial

ROSSerial is a protocol for wrapping standard ROS serialized messages and multiplexing multiple topics and services over a device such as a serial port or network socket. In addition to a protocol definition, there are three types of packages found in this suite:

- Client Libraries: Client libraries allow users to easily get ROS nodes up and running on various systems. These clients are ports of the general ANSI C++ rosserial_client library. 

- ROS-side Interfaces: These packages provide a node for the host machine to bridge the connection from the rosserial protocol to the more general ROS network.

- Examples and Use Cases. 

It is worth saying that this option cannot be fully compared with micro-ROS because this approach is meant to work with ROS 1, instead of micro-ROS which is focused on ROS 2.

## RIOT-ROS2

RIOT-ROS2 is a modification of the main ROS 2 stack, to make it able to run on microcontrollers thanks to the RIOT Operating System.

ROS 2 is composed of several layers. Some have been modified to be able to run on the microcontroller, this is a list of the available layers for RIOS-ROS2 project:
- ROS Client Library bindings: RCLC
- ROS Client Library: RCL
- ROS MiddleWare: rmw_ndn
- ROS IDL Generators: generator_c
- ROS IDL Type Support: CBOR
- ROS IDL Interfaces:
    - common_interfaces
    - rcl_interfaces

As a final data, it looks like the development is frozen. This consideration is due to the fact that the last commit goes back to [July 2018](https://github.com/astralien3000/riot-ros2/commits/master).
