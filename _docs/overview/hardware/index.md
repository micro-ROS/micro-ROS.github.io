micro-ROS targets mid-range and high-performance 32-bits microcontrollers families.
For the moment, all official ports are based on the [STM32 series](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html) from [ST](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) and on the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) from [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en).
The former feature ARM Cortex-M processors with many peripherals such as GPIO, communication or coprocessors, and the second are highly-integrated chips with in-built antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power management modules.

By default, micro-ROS uses [NuttX RTOS](https://nuttx.org/), but it also has ports for [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) and [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/). These RTOSes have a big variety of supported MCUs and development boards. The following list shows some of them:

+ MicroChip PIC32MX Family
+ Atmel SAMA5Dx
+ STM32F1/2/3/4 and STM32L1/4, that includes many Nucleo board support.
+ Renesas M16C/26
+ NXP/Freescale i.MX1/6 and i.MX RT
+ Silicon Labs EFM32 Gecko and Giant Gecko
+ XTENSA board, that includes ESP32
+ RISC-V boards

<!-- TODO (pablogs): Update this paragraph to a more generic porting guide link  -->
<!-- Please check [this link](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/Supported+Platforms) to see the complete list and the status of each board. In case you are interested in porting new boards or MCUs, please check the [next link](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTTX/Porting+Guide). -->

Among the many boards that can be used potentially by virtue of the variety of RTOSes supported, for the moment we officially supoort the four boards listed and detailed below. These are the hardware platforms that we use to test and develop micro-ROS, with which we also present accessories that we frequently refer to, such as add-on boards, and JTAG probes.

For the ease of use, micro-ROS provides a ready to use example for some development boards. These out-of-the-box examples aim to show micro-ROS capabilities and they are also a starting point for developing embedded ROS 2 applications.

## Reference Platforms {#evaluation-boards}

This section describes the main characteristic of the boards officially supported by the micro-ROS project.

## Olimex LTD STM32-E407

![Olimex](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/images/STM32-E407-02.jpg)

The [Olimex LTD STM32-E407](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/ST/STM32-E407/open-source-hardware) is an open-hardware low-cost entry board for developing custom applications with the STM32F407ZGT6 Cortex-M4F microcontrollers from STMicroelectronics.

It contains 196KB of RAM and 1MB of Flash. It is a very complete board thanks to the wide variety of communication interfaces it offers: USB OTG, Ethernet, SD Card slot, SPI, CAN or I2C buses are exposed. The board contains various expansion options available: Arduino-like headers for attaching daughter boards, many pins exposed, as well as a UEXT connector. This connector is a custom pin-out bus and is used to attach sensor breakouts that manufacturer sells.

Ports for micro-ROS on all supported RTOS are available for this board. Please see our [**First micro-ROS Application on an RTOS**](/docs/tutorials/core/first_application_rtos/) tutorial for how to start developing with this board.

### Development tools

In order to flash and debug the board, it is required to get a JTAG probe. We recommend getting one of the following JTAG probes:

+ [ARM-USB-OCD-H](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-USB-OCD-H/)
+ [ARM-USB-TINY-H](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-USB-TINY-H/)
