[micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/) Galactic and Rolling offers new and standalone support for NuttXâ€™s latest versions, namely 10.0 and 10.1. 

NuttX is a real-time operating system [(RTOS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTOS) with an emphasis on technical standards compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 32-bit microcontroller environments.

Micro XRCE-DDS, the micro-ROS middleware implementation, provides support for NuttX version 10. The [XRCE-DDS client](https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Client) can run on top of the NuttX Real time operating system. 

You can check instructions for this new port in our [micro-ROS Github organization](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_nuttx_app).
