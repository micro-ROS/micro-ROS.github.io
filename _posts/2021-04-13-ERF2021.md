On April 13th 2021, we presented micro-ROS at the [European Robotics Forum 2021](https://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_forum/)

In this workshop, Francesca Finoccharo (eProsima) presented in detail the micro-ROS architecture, supported platforms and reported recent developments and features: A versatile API for custom transports, continious fragment mode, static memory pools in the RMW and time synchronization beween client and agent. ([slides](/download/2021-04-13-ERF-eprosima.pdf))

Then, Jan Staschulat (Bosch) gave an overview of the RCLC API of micro-ROS and highlighted the deterministic RCLC Executor. ([slides](/download/2021-04-13-ERF-bosch.pdf)) Two customers of micro-ROS presented their industrial use-cases and emphasized the benefit of micro-ROS: First, Ana&euml;lle Sarazin (WYCA Robotics) presented "Elodie and micro-ROS" ([slides](/download/2021-04-13-ERF-wyca.pdf)) and, secondly, Tomasz Rokosz (Hydra System) presented "micro-ROS enabled GNSS receiver" ([slides](/download/2021-04-13-ERF-hydra.pdf)) ([video of the demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTEnTju1Qkg))

Finally, we hosted a panel discussion with Pablo Garrido Sanchez (eProsima), Alexandre Malki (PIAP), Jan Staschulat (Bosch), Ana&euml;lle Sarazin (WYCA Robotics) and Tomasz Rokosz (Hydra System) which stimulated a very lively participation of the audience.
