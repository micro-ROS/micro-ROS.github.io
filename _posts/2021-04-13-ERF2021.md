On April 13th 2021, we presented micro-ROS at the [European Robotics Forum 2021](https://eu-robotics.net/european-robotics-forum/) in a dedicated workshop organized by several partners of this project. First, Francesca Finoccharo (eProsima) presented in detail the micro-ROS architecture, the supported platforms, several demonstrations and reported on new features: A versatile API for custom transports, continuous fragment mode, static memory pools in the RMW and time synchronization between client and agent:

Then, Jan Staschulat (Bosch) gave an overview of the RCLC API with a code example and highlighted the deterministic behavior of the RCLC Executor:

Two customers of micro-ROS presented their industrial use-cases and emphasized the benefit of micro-ROS: First, Ana&euml;lle Sarazin (WYCA Robotics) presented "Elodie and micro-ROS":

Finally, a panel discussion with Pablo Garrido Sanchez (eProsima), Alexandre Malki (PIAP), Jan Staschulat (Bosch), Ana&euml;lle Sarazin (WYCA Robotics) and Tomasz Rokosz (Hydra System) stimulated a very lively participation of the audience.
