title: micro-ROS lands on Arduino

As in the last months more and more users have been manifesting an intrest in having micro-ROS on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), we have been working in order to make this integration come to life.

Arduino is an IDE designed to fit into extremely resource-constrained devices, offering an easy-to-use framework for programming MCUs among which, especially, a vast suite of development boards carrying the Arduino brand.

Based on this and on our recent release of a straight-to-the-point [micro-ROS standalone library](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup/pull/190), which was already successfully integrated with the [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_espidf_component) and [Zephyr build system](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_zephyr_module), we were able to give support to the Arduino IDE.

At present, it has already been ported it to several boards, namely: the the OpenCR 1.0, the Teensy 3.2 and 4.0/4.1, the Arduino Zero and the Arduino Due.

This new integration is especially interesting in that it paves the way for a bare-metal support for micro-ROS.
