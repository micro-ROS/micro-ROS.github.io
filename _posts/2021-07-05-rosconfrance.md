On June 23rd 2021, we presented micro-ROS at the [ROSCOn France](https://roscon.fr/) as invited speakers to contribute to the topic: micro-ROS: bringing ROS 2 to microcontrollers

This session was presented by several partners of this project. The main objectives of this session were to introduce the micro-ROS framework, its architecture and current maturity as well as the default middleware Micro XRCE-DDS.

First, Maria Merlan (eProsima) presented in detail a very clear and easy to follow introduction on how to bring ROS-2 to microcontrollers and the micro-ROS middleware architecture and the supported platforms.

Secondly, Jan Staschulat (Bosch)  gave us precisions on the architecture and how to code with rclc.

Finally Pablo Garrido (eProsima) performed a live demonstration on “using micro-ROS with the [ESP32 board](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32)”.

At the end, they had a public chat with numerous questions by the French robotics community.
We are happy about having been participants in the ROSCon France 2021 and therefore  contribute to further dissemination of the micro-ROS framework as well as to improve participation by French roboticists in global open source robotics activities.
