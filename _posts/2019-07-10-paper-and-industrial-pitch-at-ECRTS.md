[ECRTS (Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems)](https://www.ecrts.org/) is one of the most important scientific conferences of the real-time community. This year's edition was held from 9 to 12 July in Stuttgart, Germany.

## Paper on a Response-Time Analysis of ROS 2

Tobias Blass, PhD student at Bosch Research and supervised by Björn B. Brandenburg of the Real-Time Systems Group of the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, presented the paper

*Daniel Casini, Tobias Blass, Ingo Lütkebohle, and Björn B. Brandenburg: "Response-Time Analysis of ROS 2 Processing Chains Under Reservation-Based Scheduling". Proc. of ECRTS '19. Stuttgart, Germany. July 2019.*

which is available at [http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10743/](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10743/). One of the major contribution is a formal scheduling model of the ROS 2 rclcpp Executor. The results of this research have been also discussed in the new [ROS 2 Real-Time Working Group](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros2-real-time-working-group-online-meeting-may-20th-2019-between-7am-and-8am-pdt-utc-7/9196) and they are an important input for the work on an rcl-level Executor in micro-ROS.

## Industrial Pitch on Real-Time Execution Mechanisms

Ralph Lange from Bosch Research motivated the need for practical and easy-to-use real-time execution mechanisms for ROS in the industrial pitch session and the subsequent poster session. As a matter of course, on the [poster](/download/2019-07-10_Real-time_in_robotics_Industrial_pitch_at_ECRTS.pdf), he also present the micro-ROS project and the plans for an rcl-level Executor with LET semantics.
