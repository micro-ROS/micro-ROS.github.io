title: Micro XRCE-DDS Agent now on snap!

In collaboration with [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), we took the liberty to wrap the [Micro XRCE-DDS Agent](https://micro-xrce-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/agent.html) as a [snap](https://snapcraft.io/) package, which sets an important milestone for easing the use of Micro XRCE-DDS.

Snap is a package manager designed to bundle and handle applications and their dependencies on several Linux distros, among which Ubuntu.

The snap packaging of the Agent comes with two ways of running it: as a simple executable or by means of a Linux service.

The first implies the usage of the Agent’s built-in CLI, where you can specify the standard configuration parameters (such as transport, port…) directly, as follows:
```
micro-xrce-dds-agent <transport> <args>
```

The second launches the Agent as a Linux service running in the background; to do so, simply execute:
```
snap set micro-xrce-dds-agent daemon=true
```
In this case, instead of specifying the Agent’s launch parameters via the CLI, users can configure them thanks to the `snap services` interface, using the `snap set micro-xrce-dds-agent <param>=<value>` command. These parameters’ values are only valid when the `daemon` option is set to `true`, while they are ignored in `snap run` mode.

Given the closeness of the two Agents libraries, a snap release of the micro-ROS Agent is just one step away!
