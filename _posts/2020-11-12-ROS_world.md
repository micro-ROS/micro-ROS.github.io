This year's ROSCon, due to the pandemic, has been transformed into a virtual event, full of awesome presentations and discussions, the [ROS World 2020 Conference](https://roscon.ros.org/world/2020/)!

We have been hosted by the [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) parallel track session, and the presentation circled around micro-ROS’ latest features and developments, after a due, though brief, introduction to the project. Among the topics that were discussed:

- [micro-ROS twofold build system approach](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup/pull/190)
- Integration into [Arduino](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_arduino), [Zephyr](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_zephyr_module) and [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_espidf_component) development frameworks
- Client-Agent matching by [discovery](https://discourse.ros.org/t/discovery-in-micro-ros/16611)
- [Graph support](https://discourse.ros.org/t/graph-support-in-micro-ros/17266)
- p2p functionality (WIP)
- [New demo: micro-ROS & MoveIt](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS_moveit2_demo)
- [micro-ROS goes AIoT](https://discourse.ros.org/t/micro-ros-goes-aiot/17407): integration with [DephtAI](https://luxonis.com/depthai), by [LUXonis](https://luxonis.com/)

And that’s not it! micro-ROS will be also present as a featured guest in a bunch of other talks by collaborators and friends, among which Nuno Marques from the [Dronecode Foundation](https://www.dronecode.org/) and Francisco Melendez from FIWARE.
