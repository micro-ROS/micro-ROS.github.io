The international workshop on [Autonomous Systems Design (ASD)](http://asd2019.userweb.mwn.de/) brought together about 50 researchers working on embedded and cyber-physical systems platform technologies as well as on methodologies for the design of autonomous and dependable systems. It was co-located with the [DATE conference](https://www.date-conference.com/), which is one of the most important conferences and exhibition on electronic systems design and test.

On invitation, Ralph Lange from Bosch provided an overview of the micro-ROS project and recent developments in ROS 2. He also pointed to the new micro-ROS community demo, which had been unveiled at the European Robotics Forum in Bucharest the week before.
