The ROS Developers Podcast ([www.theconstructsim.com/category/ros_developers_podcast/](http://www.theconstructsim.com/category/ros_developers_podcast/)) was launched by [The Construct](http://www.theconstructsim.com/)'s CEO Ricardo TÃ©llez. On a weekly to biweekly basis, he publishes a half-hour interview with developers from the ROS community.

In [**episode 29**](http://www.theconstructsim.com/rdp-029-bosch-ros-projects-ralph-lange/), from November 2018, Ralph Lange from Bosch was interviewed. He presented several works related to micro-ROS, including the Callback-group-level Executor and the system modes concept. Ralph particularly emphasized the need for real-time execution mechanisms in ROS 2 and micro-ROS.
