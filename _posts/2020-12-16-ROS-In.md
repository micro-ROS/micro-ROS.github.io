micro-ROS was presented at the 2020 ROS-Industrial Conference in a joint talk given by Ralph Lange from Bosch, and by Francesca Finocchiaro and Pablo Garrido Sanchez from eProsima.

In the first part of the talk, Ralph Lange discussed real-time support and determinism in both ROS 2 and micro-ROS, which is an important requirement for industrial automation. The talk also addressed the most recent developments added in the Foxy release for the Callback-group-level Executor and the roadmap for the Galactic release. Finally, he presented details on the rclc Executor for deeply embedded applications such as those addressed by micro-ROS.

In the second part of the talk, Francesca Finocchiaro provided an overview of the micro-ROS project with a focus on its latest features and developments, and subsequently Pablo Garrido Sanch√©z presented an entry-level hands-on demonstration intended for people willing to get started with micro-ROS.
