title: micro-ROS porting to ESP32

The micro-ROS team is glad to announce that the pool of boards officially supported by the project has widened! The [ESP32 MCU](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) is now part of the family. ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth, widely used for both commercial and industrial purposes.

micro-ROS targets mid-range and medium-to-high performance 32-bits microcontrollers families. Up to now, the boards officially supported by the project were solely based on the STM32 series from ST, MCUs featuring ARM Cortex-M processors. On the other hand, the ESP32 is an ultra-low power consumption dual-core system with two Xtensa LX6 CPUs, exposing a large collection of peripherals.

Specifically, the port has been carried out for an Espressif [ESP32-DevKitC-32E](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc), an entry-level development board featuring an [ESP32-WROOM-32E](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32e_esp32-wroom-32ue_datasheet_en.pdf) module integrating Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functions. The port makes use of FreeRTOS, one of the three [RTOSes](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/concepts/rtos/) officially supported by the micro-ROS project, which is natively used by this family of boards, and supports the latest Foxy release of ROS 2. It works both with serial and Wi-Fi transports, the latter being particularly appealing as it marks the first hardware support of the micro-ROS project that exploits a natively integrated Wi-Fi antenna. Therefore, thanks to the combination of this highly capable Espressif board with micro-ROS, users will be able to develop wireless ROS2 applications that take advantage of the huge set of peripherals that ESP32 offers: I²C, SPI, I²S, LED drivers, PWM, etc. Furthermore, the ESP32-DevKitC-32E development board perfectly fits the typical requirements of the IoT systems targeted by micro-ROS, as it features a Flash memory of 4 MB, 448 KB ROM for booting and core functions, 520 KB SRAM for data and instructions and 16 KB SRAM in RTC.

The recent port of micro-ROS to ESP32 thus sets a milestone towards expanding the family of MCUs supported by micro-ROS and paves the way for further ports, ensuring this project an ever wider base of hardware support.

In order to try the new port, follow one of the [core tutorials](https://micro-ros.github.io//docs/tutorials/core/overview/) to install the micro-ROS build system, and then follow the instructions below: 

```bash

ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh freertos esp32
ros2 run micro_ros_setup configure_firmware.sh int32_publisher -t udp -i [your local machine IP] -p 8888
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh menuconfig

# Now go to the micro-ROS Transport Settings → WiFi Configuration menu and fill your WiFi SSID and password. Save your changes, exit the interactive menu, and run:
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh

# Connect your ESP32 to the computer with a micro-USB cable, and run:
ros2 run micro_ros_setup flash_firmware.sh
```

In order to open an agent you can find instructions [here](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/tutorials/core/first_application_linux/) but we recommend using the docker image:

```
docker run -it --rm --net=host microros/micro-ros-agent:foxy udp4 --port 8888 -v6

```
