We are glad to announce that the ROS 2 Embedded Working Group meetings are back!

Starting the next 22nd of July, at 5 pm CEST (8 am PDT) they'll be retaken with a 4-weekly periodicity and with a
special focus on micro-ROS and its middleware, Micro XRCE-DDS.

The community is kindly invited to participate and to bring any micro-ROS related issues, doubts and projects to this
platform.

The proper way to be regularly updated and informed regarding the WG activities is to register to the dedicated Slack
chat. To do so, go to the [micro-ROS main page](https://micro-ros.github.io/) and get an invitation by subscribing
with your email address on the right bottom of the main page.

Please find [here](http://meet.google.com/saf-gjix-swf) the link to the Google meet and
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hGxwpuHDPCyEYHBCd5IIgvoFGJgkC5WKI12ghEfqwXg/edit?usp=sharing) the agenda for
the first meeting.
Everyone is welcome to add items that they consider relevant in the form of comments.
