On September 23rd, the [FIWARE Foundation](https://www.fiware.org/foundation/) held a webinar titled “Enabling Robotics Systems on Microcontrollers”, as a part of its series of free webinars about open source platform components for Smart Solutions.

The webinar focused on the interoperability between micro-ROS and FIWARE, made possible by [eProsima Integration-Service](https://integration-service.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/) and its core [SOSS](https://soss.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/). SOSS is a platform that acts as a centralizing bridge to communicate incompatible protocols that speak different languages. Its working principle rests on System-Handles, plugins that put the core into communication with each of the protocols that are meant to be integrated into the platform. Once a system is integrated by means of a dedicated System-Handle, it can speak with any other system that is already integrated into the SOSS world.
The SOSS-ROS2 and the SOSS-FIWARE System-Handles serve as key enablers to integrate micro-ROS into the FIWARE ecosystem, a framework of open source platform components which can be assembled together and with other third-party platform components to accelerate the development of Smart Robotics Solutions. 

Key contributions of Powered by FIWARE architectures to micro-ROS applications are:

* Interfacing with the Internet of Things (IoT), Robots and third-party systems, for capturing updates on context information and translating required actuations.
* Context Data/API management, publication, and monetization, bringing support to usage control and the opportunity to publish and monetize part of managed context data.
* Processing, analysis, and visualization of context information implementing the expected smart behavior of applications and/or assisting end users in making smart decisions
