The FIWARE Foundation, member of the EU project OFERA, has worked on a dissemination video for micro-ROS, to bring it to an ever broader audience.

Ralph Lange, project manager in robotics systems & software engineering at Bosch Corporate Research,
one of the parties leading the micro-ROS project, has been interviewed at the IoT Solutions World Congress in Barcelona in October 2019.
Ralph gives its voice to detail what the micro-ROS project is about and explain its main features very clearly and
straightforwardly.
