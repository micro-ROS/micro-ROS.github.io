The FIWARE Foundation, member of the OFERA consortium, has worked on a dissemination video for micro-ROS, to bring it to an ever broader audience.

Ralph Lange, Research Project Manager of the Robotics Systems & Software Engineering department at Bosch Corporate Research,
one of the parties leading the micro-ROS project, has been interviewed at the European Robotics Forum held in Malaga in March 2020.
Ralph gives its voice to detail what the micro-ROS project is about and explain its main features very clearly and
straightforwardly.
