ROS-Industrial Consortium Europe (RIC-EU) hosted a Spring 2019 edition of their RIC-EU Tech Workshop.
This edition took place on the 6th and 7th of May at Fraunhofer IPA in Stuttgart, Germany.
This workshop was focused on DDS and ROS 2 developments for which members of the EU project OFERA were invited as Speakers.
The OFERA members who assisted were Ralph Lange and Ingo Lütkebohle from BOSCH research and Jaime Martin and Borja Outerelo from eProsima.

The workshop was split in two days, the first one was focused on DDS and an introduction to ROS 2, presented by Jaime Martin and Borja Outerelo respectively.
The first half of the second day was filled with ROS 2 and micro-ROS presentations, from BOSCH partners, Ralph and Ingo.
The second day was closed by Fraunhofer IPA representatives, Ludovic Delval and Harsh Deshpande presenting the migration of packages from ROS 1 to ROS 2.

On day 1 and after the workshop presentation done by RIC-EU manager Thilo Zimmermann, Borja provided some rationale on the usage of DDS in the ROS 2 implementation and a hands-on with ros2 tools.

Following this presentation, Jaime in-depth explained DDS concepts and eProsima DDS implementation.
During this presentation, the assistants got the chance to use eProsima FastRTPS during a hands-on with their ShapesDemo and played around with some of the DDS QoS on top of a traditional "hello world" example.

Staring Day 2, Ralph Lange gave an in-depth presentation of the current status of ROS 2 and some of the changes for the upcoming release, Dashing Diademata.
Assistants had the chance to practice with ROS 2 with several hands-on parts proposed during the presentation.

Following, Ingo Lütkebohle introduced the micro-ROS project.
He presented all the work the EU project OFERA is doing to bring microcontrollers into the ROS 2 ecosystem.
During his presentation, Ingo showcased the work done using [micro-ROS demo on top of Kobuki](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS_kobuki_demo).
